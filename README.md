# Pawn-Dashboard-using-Looker-Studio
This dashboard was built for Pawn Lead(http://pos.pawnleads.com/). We built the interacting dashboard using Looker Studio from Google Sheets.
In Google Sheets, we calculated MoM, QoQ and YoY values using formulas and it made the dashboard more visualible and available.
